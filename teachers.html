<p>The educations of the <strong>Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool</strong>&#39;s students get a big extra boost from the additional daily help of two co-op members, performing their <a href="cooperate.html">duty day</a>, but their <strong><em>complete educational needs</em></strong> will be met by our outstanding, qualified and caring staff.</p>

<p>In our classroom, your preschooler will learn through play, and be helped along on these first steps onto the paths of education by the following capable hands:&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ms. Nevala has been an early Childhood educator for many years. She takes &quot;pride in developing programs where young children can learn through new challenges, happily and at their own pace.&quot; She believes in creating classrooms that will inspire and educate preschoolers. Most strongly, Sue-Ellen believes that children must have fun while learning. In our community Ms. Nevala&#39;s professionalism is recognized through her ten years work at Fern Hill School in Rockliffe, and the Good Morning School, another Ottawa cooperative preschool. Sue-Ellen says &quot;I am so happy to have spent the last ten&nbsp;years working at Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool.&quot; Well, we&#39;ve been happy to have her!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is Stepfanie&#39;s second year with the Westboro Village Cooperative Preschool. After finishing high school, she was a nanny for a school year to three young boys. The following year, Stepfanie attended Algonquin College for Early Childhood Education. When asked about her favourite part of being a preschool teacher, Stepfanie said &quot;seeing the kids learn and grow and knowing that I was a part of creating an education that will shape and mold them into future leaders.&quot; As a preschool teacher, she is looking forward to creating lessons and activities that the kids will learn from and enjoy.</p>
